# Installation

Installing LOD Generator Pro into your Unity project is simple. As this is a premium tool, it is distributed via the Unity Asset Store.

## Unity Asset Store

1. Open the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) in your browser or directly inside the Unity Editor (`Window > Asset Store` or `Window > Package Manager`).
2. Search for **LOD Generator Pro**.
3. Click **Purchase**, then click **Add to My Assets**.
4. Inside Unity, open the **Package Manager** (`Window > Package Manager`).
5. Change the dropdown in the top-left to **My Assets**.
6. Search for "LOD Generator Pro".
7. Click **Download**, then click **Import**.
8. In the Import Unity Package window, ensure all files are checked and click **Import**.

## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3 (LTS) or newer.
- Supports Built-In Render Pipeline, URP, and HDRP. 

## Upgrading
If you are upgrading from a previous version of LOD Generator Pro, it is recommended to delete the old `Assets/LODGeneratorPro` folder before importing the new version to avoid any legacy script conflicts.

> **Pro Tip:**
> Check the Console after importing. LOD Generator Pro should print a success message once initialized. You will now see the `LOD Generator Pro` menu in your Unity Editor toolbar!
