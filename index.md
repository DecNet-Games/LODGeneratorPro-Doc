# LOD Generator Pro

Stop doing manual work. Turn your heavy scenes into high-performance builds in just 3 clicks.

LOD Generator Pro is the ultimate non-destructive LOD generation and optimization tool built specifically for the Unity Editor. Whether you're targeting mobile devices, VR, or struggling with WebGL build sizes, this tool acts as your "Fix Performance in 2 minutes" button.

## The Problem
Every Unity developer eventually hits a wall:
- Unstable FPS drops on lower-end devices.
- Bloated memory usage preventing mobile or WebGL deployment.
- "I'll optimize it later" syndrome where optimization is endlessly delayed because manual LOD setup is boring and time-consuming.

## The Solution
**LOD Generator Pro** completely automates the tedious process of mesh simplification and LODGroup assignment. 

- **Automatic Mesh Simplification**: Instantly generate LOD0, LOD1, LOD2, and LOD3.
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize empty scenes, complex environments, or entire folders of assets in minutes.
- **Auto LOD Group Setup**: Configure transition thresholds based on target platforms (Mobile, PC, VR, Console).
- **Non-Destructive Workflows**: Creates optimized duplicates of your meshes safely with total Undo support.
